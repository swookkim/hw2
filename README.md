The first week homework (Sangwook Kim). 

I try to build the website for promoting Lego's newly launched product "NASA Space Shuttle Discovery"

The website is offering three pages 1) Home page (index) 2) Deliveries and returns 3) Other Lego Space Series

Additionally I have a question about coding:
When we write a code, which is better? 1. making it as short as possible or 2. changing lines and putting comments frequently to make it more readable
